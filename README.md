# Bayesian Hawkes Process and Nonparametric Modeling for Complex Systems

## 🎯 Project Objective
This project demonstrates the application of stochastic process modeling (Hawkes Process) and Nonparametric Bayesian methods (Dirichlet Process Mixture) to analyze self-exciting events in real-world time-series data (e.g., COVID-19 cases). The goal is to make complex, temporal dependencies tractable through advanced computational inference techniques, aligning with the UvA CSL mission.

## 🛠️ Key Technical Skills Demonstrated
* **Stochastic Processes:** Implementation and parameter estimation (MLE) of the Hawkes Process.
* **Bayesian Inference:** Use of JAGS for full posterior estimation.
* **Nonparametric Methods:** Application of Dirichlet Process Mixture Models for flexible distribution modeling.
* **Rigor:** Model validation via **Transformed Residual Analysis** (Exponentiality Test).

## 📄 Files
* `Hawkes_Process_Bayesian_Modeling.R`: Core script for MLE, Bayesian estimation (JAGS), and Dirichlet Process modeling.
* `Hawkes_Process_Diagnostic_Analysis.R`: Dedicated script for rigorous residual analysis (QQ-Plots, K-S Test) to validate the model fit.
